# Nadel Logo Assets

This directory contains the official logo assets for the Nadel project.

## Available Variations

- `nadel-logo-dark.svg` - White monochrome version for dark backgrounds
- `nadel-logo-light.svg` - Black monochrome version for light backgrounds
- `nadel-logo-color.svg` - Full color version using Atlassian brand colors

## Design Elements

The logo incorporates several meaningful elements:
- A hexagonal shape inspired by the GraphQL logo, representing Nadel's GraphQL foundation
- A needle and thread design, reflecting both the name "Nadel" (German for "needle") and the schema stitching functionality
- Atlassian brand colors in the color version (#0052CC and #172B4D)

## Usage Guidelines

- Use the dark version on dark backgrounds for maximum contrast
- Use the light version on light backgrounds for maximum contrast
- Use the color version when you want to emphasize the brand identity
- Maintain clear space around the logo equal to the height of the hexagon's point
- Do not modify the colors or proportions of the logo
- Minimum recommended size: 32px height to maintain legibility
